Using SQL I analyzed a database containing information about Transport for London journeys over 12 years (period from 2010 to 2022).

SELECT JOURNEY_TYPE, SUM(JOURNEYS_MILLIONS) AS TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS
FROM TFL.JOURNEYS
GROUP BY JOURNEY_TYPE
ORDER BY TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS DESC;

2. The popularity of Emirates Airline.

SELECT MONTH, YEAR, ROUND(JOURNEYS_MILLIONS, 2) AS ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS 
FROM TFL.JOURNEYS
WHERE ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS IS NOT NULL AND JOURNEY_TYPE  = 'Emirates Airline'
ORDER BY ROUNDED_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS DESC
LIMIT 5;

3. The Tube least popular years.

SELECT YEAR, JOURNEY_TYPE, SUM(JOURNEYS_MILLIONS) AS TOTAL_JOURNEYS_MILLIONS
